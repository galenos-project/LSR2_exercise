## Study description

10 of the studies were RCTs, and 1 was a crossover RCT (Greene & Petruzzello, 2022).The specific intervention and comparison groups for the `r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))+length(table(LSR2weeksStata2insufdata$studyN))` eligible studies (`r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$study))+length(table(LSR2weeksStata2insufdata$study))` comparisons) are presented in Table 1.

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

*Aerobic = physical performance behaviour pattern that increases heart rate and respiration while using large muscle groups repetitively and rhythmically; anaerobic = physical performance behaviour pattern that is performed in short intense bursts with limited oxygen intake; mixed = combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. TAU = treatment as usual; WLC = waiting list control.*

**Table 1:** Specific interventions for all the included studies

`r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))` of the `r  length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN)) + length(table(LSR2weeksStata2insufdata$studyN))` studies were included in the meta-analyses (Bryant et al., 2023; Huseth, 2021; Nordbrandt et al., 2020; Rosenbaum et al., 2015; Voorendonk et al., 2023; Whitworth et al., 2019a; Whitworth et al., 2019b; Young-McCaughan et al., 2022). Meta-analysis was not feasible for `r length(table(LSR2weeksStata2insufdata$studyN))` of the `r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))+length(table(LSR2weeksStata2insufdata$studyN))` studies (Crombie et al., 2021a; Greene & Petruzzello, 2022; Powers et al., 2015). Three of the studies provided follow-up PTSD outcome data which were insufficient for synthesis, which were synthesized descriptively without meta-analysis (Crombie et al., 2021a; Greene & Petruzzello, 2022; Powers et al., 2015). Three studies examined putative mediators which was not sufficient to carry out a meta-analysis (Crombie et al., 2021a; Powers et al., 2015; Whitworth et al., 2019a).

Study characteristics of the `r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))` studies included in the meta-analysis are are presented in Table 2. From these `r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))` studies, there were `r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$study))` eligible comparisons. One study presented findings from two independent comparisons, including a total of four distinct intervention groups (Young-McCaughan et al., 2022). One of the first authors published findings from two different but methodologically similar trials in the same year (Whitworth et al., 2019a; Whitworth et al., 2019b).

## Primary outcome

### PTSD Symptom Severity

For the studies included in the meta-analyses, the earliest study was performed in `r format(min((data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$year)), format="%Y")`, while the most recent study was performed in `r format(max((data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$year)), format="%Y")`. The median sample size across the studies was `r round(median(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$totNrandom, na.rm=T))` participants per study. The median of the mean participant age was `r round(median((data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$AGEm), na.rm=T))` years (ranging from `r round(min((data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$AGEm),na.rm=T))` to `r round(max((data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$AGEm),na.rm=T))` years).

#### Post-intervention (weeks)

`r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))` studies provided data for PTSD symptom severity and contributed `r length(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$tg1PTSD3PTm)` effect measures to the PTSD symptom severity meta-analysis. The forest plot for PTSD symptom severity is presented in Figure 2.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
#SUMMARIZE the SMDs from studies using metacont & POOL the data 
LSR2mainMA = metacont(tg1PTSD3PTn , tg1PTSD3PTm ,tg1PTSD3PTsd ,tg2PTSD3PTn, tg2PTSD3PTm, tg2PTSD3PTsd ,
                      data = data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2, studlab = study, sm = "SMD")

forest(LSR2mainMA, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       prediction=T,
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours control",
       leftcols = c("study", "Intervention", "Comparison"),
       rightcols = c("effect", "ci"),
       fs.study = 10, ff.study = "italic",
       col.diamond = "blue", col.diamond.lines = "black",
       col.square = "turquoise", col.square.lines = "black")
```

**Figure 2:** Meta-analysis of the effects of exercise on PTSD symptom severity.

The meta-analysis found no evidence of a difference in PTSD symptom severity reduction between exercise and comparison groups (`r paste0(LSR2mainMA$sm, " = ", round(LSR2mainMA$TE.random, 2), ", 95% CI ", round(LSR2mainMA$lower.random, 2), " to ", round(LSR2mainMA$upper.random, 2))`). Low heterogeneity was found as suggested by the prediction interval which is only slightly wider than the confidence interval.

#### Subgroup Analyses and Meta-regressions

We explored whether heterogeneity could be potentially explained by differences in study-level characteristics using subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. The following characteristics were explored as sources of heterogeneity for the primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity:

-   Exercise intensity (moderate intensity or high intensity)

-   Specific exercise type (aerobic, anaerobic or mixed)

-   Exercise augmented by treatment as usual (TAU)/therapy (exercise only or exercise + therapy/TAU)

-   Intervention length (weeks)

##### Subgroup analysis by exercise intensity

The test for interaction found some evidence of a difference between studies with moderate intensity and those with high-intensity exercise  (Figure 3). Visual inspection of the forest plot suggests that effect is larger in the high intensity exercise subgroup.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
subgroup.intensity = update(LSR2mainMA, subgroup = intensityEX2) 

# produce a forest plot
forest(subgroup.intensity, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       prediction=T,
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours control",
       leftcols = c("study", "Intervention", "Comparison"),
       rightcols = c( "effect", "ci"),
       fs.study = 10, ff.study = "italic",
       col.diamond = "blue", col.diamond.lines = "black",
       col.square = "turquoise", col.square.lines = "black")
```

**Figure 3:** Sub-group analysis of the effects of exercise on PTSD symptom severity by exercise intensity

##### Subgroup analysis by specific exercise type

The test for interaction found no evidence of a difference in PTSD severity between aerobic, anaerobic, or mixed exercise groups (Figure 4).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
# create a new R object subgroup.tg1specEX  
subgroup.tg1specEX = update(LSR2mainMA, subgroup = tg1specEX2) 

# produce a forest plot 
forest(subgroup.tg1specEX, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       prediction=T,
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours control",
       leftcols = c("study", "Intervention", "Comparison"),
       rightcols = c( "effect", "ci"),
       fs.study = 10, ff.study = "italic",
       col.diamond = "blue", col.diamond.lines = "black",
       col.square = "turquoise", col.square.lines = "black")
```

**Figure 4:** Sub-group analysis of the effects of exercise on PTSD symptom severity by specific exercise type

##### Subgroup analysis by exercise alone or tau/therapy augmented by exercise.

The test for interaction found some evidence of a difference between exercise alone compared with those with exercise in addition to psychotherapy or TAU (Figure 5). Visual inspection of the forest plot suggests that effect is larger for studies with exercise alone.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=6}
# create a new R object subgroup.EXEaug  
subgroup.EXEaug = update(LSR2mainMA, subgroup = EXEaug2) 

# produce a forest plot using the JAMA layout.
forest(subgroup.EXEaug, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       prediction=T,
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',
       label.right = "Favours control",
       leftcols = c("study", "Intervention", "Comparison"),
       rightcols = c( "effect", "ci"),
       fs.study = 10, ff.study = "italic",
       col.diamond = "blue", col.diamond.lines = "black",
       col.square = "turquoise", col.square.lines = "black")
```

**Figure 5:** Sub-group analysis of the effects of exercise on PTSD symptom severity by exercise alone or TAU/therapy augmented by exercise

##### Meta-regression by intervention length

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}

# Do a meta-regression with the continuous covariate intervLENGTH (lenth of intervention - weeks) 

 intervLENGTHreg = metareg(LSR2mainMA, intervLENGTH) 

```

Overall, there is no evidence that the intervention length affected the treatment effect (Figure 6). The meta-regression analysis yielded a coefficient of `r round(intervLENGTHreg$beta[2], 2)` (95% CI: `r round(intervLENGTHreg$ci.lb[2], 2)`, `r round(intervLENGTHreg$ci.ub[2], 2)`).). Intervention length ranged from 3 weeks to 20 weeks, with a mode and median of 8 weeks. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}

# generate a bubble plot. 

bubble(intervLENGTHreg, col.line = "blue") 

```

#### Sensitivity Analyses

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
#SUMMARIZE the SMDs from studies using metacont 
rob.sens.MA = metacont(tg1PTSD3PTn , tg1PTSD3PTm ,tg1PTSD3PTsd ,tg2PTSD3PTn, tg2PTSD3PTm, tg2PTSD3PTsd ,
                      data = data.rob.sens, studlab = study, sm = "SMD")
```

We examine the robustness of the findings for the primary outcome by excluding studies with high risk of bias (Figure 7). `r length(table(data.rob.sens$study))` studies included in the meta-analyses were rated as low or some concerns. When restricting the analysis to studies with moderate or low risk of bias, the effect of exercise on PTSD symptoms severity was `r paste(rob.sens.MA$sm, "=", round(rob.sens.MA$TE.random, 2),"(95% CI:", round(rob.sens.MA$lower.random, 2), ",", round(rob.sens.MA$upper.random, 2))`). For reference, the main effect size for the primary outcome was `r paste(LSR2mainMA$sm, "=", round(LSR2mainMA$TE.random, 2),"(95% CI:", round(LSR2mainMA$lower.random, 2), ",", round(LSR2mainMA$upper.random, 2))`), so the results do not change substantially.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
#POOL the data 
forest(rob.sens.MA, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,

       col.diamond = "blue", col.diamond.lines = "black",
       col.square = "turquoise", col.square.lines = "black")
```

#### Reporting bias

Small study effects were not examined because there were fewer than 10 studies available. The forest plot below shows the meta-analysis results of the primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, ordered by the precision of the studies is presented in Figure 8. The smaller studies showed larger effects favoring the exercise groups compared to the larger studies which cluster around the line of no effect. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}

#### Synthesis Without Meta-analysis

Meta-analysis could not be conducted for three studies addressing the primary outcome of PTSD symptom severity (Crombie et al., 2021a; Greene & Petruzzello, 2022; Powers et al., 2015). Two of the studies did not report outcome data for PTSD symptom severity post-intervention (Crombie et al., 2021a; Greene & Petruzzello, 2022). The third study did not provide sufficient data to include in the meta-analysis (Powers et al., 2015).\
Powers et al. (2015) examined the efficacy of adding moderate-intensity aerobic exercise before prolonged exposure (PE) in reducing PTSD symptoms. The participants who underwent PE plus exercise experienced a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms (d = 2.65). compared to the group that received PE only. This outcome was observed after the 12-week intervention.

#### Risk of bias for the PTSD symptom severity

The results of the risk of bias assessment per domain and study for the primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity is presented below in Figure 9 of the Extended Data. Nine studies reported PTSD outcome data post-intervention. Two studies did not report PTSD outcome data (Crombie et al., 2021a; Greene & Petruzzello, 2022). Five of the nine studies had an overall high risk of bias, three had some concerns, and only one was had low risk of bias. High risk of bias was mainly due to deviations from intended intervention (D2)(Voorendonk et al., 2023; Whitworth et al., 2019a; Whitworth et al., 2019b), missing outcome data (D3)(Rosenbaum et al., 2015; Voorendonk et al., 2023; Whitworth et al., 2019a; Whitworth et al., 2019b), and selection of reported results (D5)(Voorendonk et al., 2023; Young-McCaughan et al., 2022).

### Functional impairment
Two studies examined the effects of exercise on functional impairment at post-intervention (Nordbrandt et al., 2020; Voorendonk et al., 2023). One of these studyies, which compared TAU (which was constituted of psychotherapy in the form of CBT and acceptance and commitment therapy) with TAU + basic body awareness therapy  and  TAU + exercise, reported small but significant improvements over time for Quality of Life (WHO-5) (mean difference (SE) = 9.68 (2.79)(Topp et al., 2015), Global Assessment of Functioning for Symptoms (GAF-S) (mean difference (SE) = 4.37 (1.34), and Disability (Sheehan Disability Scale, SDS) (mean difference (SE) =-2.54 (0.86) for the exercise + TAU group (Nordbrandt et al., 2020). However, no significant difference over time was found for the Global Assessment of Functioning for Function (GAF-F) (mean difference (SE) = 3.64 (1.31) in the exercise +TAU group (Nordbrandt et al., 2020). While there was significant improvement in rating scores over time in both the exercise + TAU and the other 2 comparison groups (psychotherapy and control), no significant between-group differences were found at the pre- or post-intervention assessments (Voorendonk et al., 2023). The other study compared a physical exercise condition (n = 59) to a non-physical activity control condition. All participants received an 8-day intensive trauma-focused therapy programme comprising daily prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, and psychoeducation. There was a significant increase in quality of life in both the exercise and non-exercise groups, however there was no significant between-group differences (Voorendonk et al., 2023).

### Treatment Dropout

#### Post-intervention (weeks)

`r length(table(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$studyN))` studies provided data for treatment dropout, and contributed `r length(data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2$tg1Ndrop)` effect measures to the treatment dropout meta-analysis. The forest plot for the risk of treatment dropout presented in Figure 10.

```{r echo=F, fig.fullwidth=T, fig.width=11, fig.height=4}
#Summarize the study-specific risk ratios for study completors from studies using metabin
#create an object of class meta called “pooledRRdrop”
pooledRRdrop = metabin(tg1Ndrop, tg1Nrandom,	tg2Ndrop,tg2Nrandom,
                       data = data_2023_12_4_LSR2_Awks2, studlab = study, sm = "RR")

#obtain the forest plot 
forest(pooledRRdrop, 
       sortvar = EXEaug,
       common = FALSE,
       print.I2.ci = T, 
       prediction=T,
       label.left = 'Favours intervention',

**Figure 10:** Meta-analysis of the dropout rates between the intervention and control groups

No evidence of a difference in treatment dropout between exercise and comparison groups (`r paste0(pooledRRdrop$sm, " = ", round(exp(pooledRRdrop$TE.random), 2), ", 95% CI ", round(exp(pooledRRdrop$lower.random), 2), " to ", round(exp(pooledRRdrop$upper.random), 2))`) was found and there was large heterogeneity, as shown by the prediction interval (`r paste(round(exp(pooledRRdrop$lower.predict), 2), "to", round(exp(pooledRRdrop$upper.predict), 2))`).

### PTSD symptom clusters

Two of the 11 studies examined the effects of exercise on PTSD symptom clusters, namely avoidance, reexperiencing, hyperarousal, as well as negative cognitions and mood (Whitworth et al., 2019a; Whitworth et al., 2019b). One study reported significantly lower levels of avoidance symptoms (d = 1.26) and hyperarousal symptoms (d = 0.90) in the exercise group relative to the control group post-intervention (Whitworth et al., 2019a). While intrusion (d = 0.67) and mood and cognitive symptoms (d = 0.34) did not differ significantly (Whitworth et al., 2019a). The other study found no significant between-group differences for intrusion (F(1, 17) < 0.01), avoidance (F(1, 17) = 0.63)mood and cognitive symptoms (F(1, 17) = 0.02), and hyperarousal symptoms (F(1, 17) = 0.21) between the exercise and comparison group (Whitworth et al., 2019b).

### Loss of PTSD diagnosis

Only one study reported data on loss of PTSD diagnosis post-intervention (Voorendonk et al., 2023). Loss of diagnosis was high in both the exercise and comparison groups. More specifically, 80.0% and 82.7% of the intervention and comparison groups respectively no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The between-group difference was non-significant.

## Mechanistic insights

Three studies examined putative mediators, but the available data was insufficient to carry out a meta-analysis (Crombie et al., 2021a; Powers et al., 2015; Whitworth et al., 2019a).

#### Synthesis Without Meta-analysis

In the first study, 35 participants were randomized to a 3-day protocol involving fear acquisition, extinction, and recall. They examined whether exercise-induced increases in circulating concentrations of candidate biomarkers mediated the effects of exercise on threat expectancy ratings during the extinction recall phase (Crombie et al., 2021a). Biomarkers included brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and homovanillic acid (HVA). 
Threat expectancy ratings evaluate an individual's anticipation levels toward encountering threatening situations. Individuals with PTSD often exhibit elevated ratings. Decreasing these anticipations may lead to a reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms. For the total effect, the exercise group exhibited lower threat expectancy ratings following reinstatement than the comparison group (d = 0.75). Circulating concentrations of BDNF (95% CI for the indirect effect, path ab: -0.941, -0.005) and AEA (95% CI for the indirect effect, path ab: -0.623, -0.005) following exercise mediated the relationship between exercise and reduced threat expectancy ratings following reinstatement. 2-AG (95% CI for the indirect effect, path ab: -0.050, -0.210) and HVA (95% CI for the indirect effect, path ab: -0.190, -0.134) did not reach statistical significance. 
The second study examined BDNF levels as a potential mediator of the relationship between exercise and PTSD symptom severity (Powers et al., 2015). Post-intervention, the exercise group experienced a significant increase in circulating concentrations of BDNF (d = 1.08).
The third study examined whether changes in cognitive appraisal, perceived exertion, affect, arousal, and distress in a sample of 22 adults with PTSD predicted changes in PTSD symptoms (Whitworth et al., 2019a). They found changes in the perception of the resistance training sessions (cognitive appraisal; b = 7.1) and perceived exertion (b = -3.1) mediated the relationship between exercise and PTSD symptom severity. Affect (b = 0.82), arousal (b = 2.4), and distress (b = 0.18) did appear to have a mediating effect. These outcomes were observed at the conclusion of the 3-week intervention. 

#### Risk of bias for the mediation studies

The results of the risk of bias assessment for the mediation analyses are presented in Figure 11. Even though two of the three mediation studies had only some concerns within the non-mediation-specific (D1-D5) components of the revised ROB2 tool (Crombie et al.,2021a; Powers et al., 2015), all of the three studies had an overall high risk of bias mainly due to the deviations in mediation-specific domains (D6-D9) (Crombie et al.,2021a; Powers et al., 2015; Whitworth et al., 2019). In the domains (D7 and D8), 100% of the mediation studies had a high risk of bias underscoring the current methodological limitation in mediation analysis and handling confounding in mediation studies (Crombie et al.,2021a; Powers et al., 2015; Whitworth et al., 2019).
